# Team Profile Generator


## Description

You have a team, you want to list them, and writing by hand is so 2002. What to do? Try out the new Team Profile Generator! With this handy tool, you can create a brand new HTML sheet with the manager of your team, and all engineers and interns. Every employee has their name, email, and employee ID displayed, as well as a property unique to their role--for managers, it's office number; for engineers, it's their GitHub username; and for interns, it's their school. Go ahead, try it out!

## Installation

To use the Team Profile generator, you'll need access to a whole slew of files--the lib folder has all files related to the Object classes built to accomodate data for employees of all types, and at the root you'll find index.js, which you run from the command line, and generateHTML.js which translates the user's data into an HTML file. Additionally, you'll need Node.js to download npm, and the packages "inquirer" for logging user responses, and "fs" for writing to a file. Using your command line, you can do all these steps and be on your way in no time!

## Usage 

When you run "node index.js" (or just, "node index" for those busy bees out there with no time to spare), you'll be prompted with a series of questions, all of which you, the user, are required to answer. By answering the questions, you're creating an array of employees that will be used to dynamically fill in an HTML file (a manager, and as many engineers and interns as you'd like to add).
